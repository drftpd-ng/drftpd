==== 4.0
* Java Plugin Framework has been removed and replaced by java reflections framework
* Now compiles and runs on JDK14
* Users groups are now seperate entities:
  - Group admins are set on the group level and no longer on the user level
  - To be a group admin it is no longer required for it to be the primary group
  - group member slots / leech slots has been moved to the group object
  - There was a notion of group ratio, which has been removed with this (pending review)
  - User files from pre 4.0 need a conversion

==== 3.0
The reasons it's 3.0 and not 2.1
* Virtual file system is now not held in memory, but saved in ./files as XML files.
  This saves memory, and speeds up the master, and lowers the overall load.
* Sources are changed to Java Plug-in Framework (JPF) to improve the modularity and 
  extensibility of DrFTPD. This allows users to create plugins without changing the
  core of DrFTPD.
* New irc sitebot along with supporting infrastructure changes.
  - Brief summary of sitebot changes/additions:
    * Sitebot now supports per user blowfish keys for private message encyrption, along with DH1080 support.
    * Supports a list of servers to cycle through in the event of disconnection or connect failure.
    * Integrated support for irc services (nickserv/chanserv) , based on ideas from a forum mod.
    * Allows binding the SiteBot to a specific IP for machines with multiple public IPs.
    * Optional high security SSL trust requiring a properly validated certificate chain or private SSL cert provided.
    * Multiple bot support (both simplistic and very experimental at this point).
    * More configurable announce targets based on either sections or path patterns.
    * Now shares the same command plugins as the ftp frontend rather than its own duplicated commands.


==== 2.0
The reasons it's 2.0 and not 1.2
* File list is now case insensitive.
* Changed usermanager to javabeans (use UserManagerConverter to convert).
  UserManager now supports adding dynamic properties (with runtime type checking).
* Dropped slaves.xml, use site [add|del]slave etc. commands.
  Uses javabeans for storage.
* Changed keys in .properties formatting, now using dynamic user data as keys.
* Added symlinks.
* Dropped RMI in favor of our own master<->slave protocol which will scale
  much better.
* Includes Teflon's ircusermanager which now uses dynamic user data.
* Permissions now configurable for every site and irc command.
* Blowfish support added to SiteBot

In progress:
* Dropped glob-style path permissions in favor of ants pattern path expressions.
* Now requires java 5.0
* Now requires ant to build, no more binary .class files.
  JDK is required by ant, JRE is not sufficient.
