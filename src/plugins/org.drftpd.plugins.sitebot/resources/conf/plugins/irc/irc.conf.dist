# Server(s) to use, you can define multiple servers here, the bot will attempt
# to connect to the first server, if that fails it'll try the next and so on.
# If it reaches the end of the list it'll loop back to the first server. If the
# bot is disconnected from the server for any reason it'll reconnect to the next
# server in the list.
# Each server is defined by host (the hostname or IP of the server), the port to
# connect to, the password for the server (if required) and whether to connect
# using ssl or not.

# Enable autonick setting, in the event the nickname set in the nick value

# Command trigger identifier, lines sent to channels or to the bot via a

## IRC SERVICES Options (ie NICKSERV/CHANSERV) , enable these if the ircd
# supports these services and you wish the bot to use them

## Additional commands to send to the server once connected, as many entries
# as required can be specified here. The value will be sent as a raw command

# they are raw commands they must follow the irc rfc for sending a command,
# ie NOT mIRC etc format

## Blowfish encryption and related settings
# Enable blowfish encryption for channels and private messages
blowfish.enable=false
# Enable DH1080 key exchange as a method for setting users blowfish keys
# This requires that you have installed the export strength crypto pack
# in your Java VM.

# Take action against users who send unencrypted text to channels or to the
# bot in private message when blowfish is enabled
blowfish.unencrypted.punish=false
# Action to take against a user if the punish option is enabled, valid options
# are kick OR ban, a ban will automatically be followed by a kick, this will be
# done in all channels the user is in. Ban masks are not set using wildcards so
# are easy to circumvent, this is intended to be used mainly to warn the user
blowfish.unencrypted.action=kick
blowfish.unencrypted.reason=Unencrypted text is not permitted


## Channels to join once the bot is successfully connected to a server, as
# many channels as desired can be added here. You can set a blowfish key
# for each channel, as well as a channel key and any other channel modes
# you would like the bot to set on joining
channel.1=#drftpd-test

## WARNING: Options following this point are intended for advanced users only,
# do not change anything in this section unless you are sure of what it does
# and what the consequences may be

# Allow more than one command to be executed at once, this controls the maximum
# number of commands that can be running at any given time. If you want the aborting
# of commands to work then this must be greater than 1 and ideally quite a bit more
commands.max=5

# Behaviour when max commands are running, there are 2 options for this setting,
# these are "block" and "queue", in queue mode commands will be queued and executed
# when other commands are finished, in block mode a command will be rejected when
# the max commands are already running.
commands.full=queue

# Local bind address to use on machines with multiple IPs. This can be set to
# either a hostname or an IP address, using a hostname is not advised if the
# DNS entry for it points to multiple IPs. A blank or undefined entry here
# causes the sitebot to bind to the primary IP
bind.host=

# Character set to use when sending to the irc server
charset=ISO-8859-1

# Maximum length of lines to use when sending messages to the server, this is the
# length of the full raw command including the CRLF at the end
line.length.max=512

# Require strict trust when validating the server certificate for SSL connections
# With this enabled the bot will only connect to servers where the certificate has
# a valid certificate chain back to a trusted root authority OR if there is a local
# copy of the certificate available. This allows the use of a self signed certificate
# for a private ircd without adding the risk of not checking the certificate
# authenticity.
# To use this feature with self signed certificates you need to add a copy of the
# certificate in a conf/plugins/irc/certs directory. The certificates should be
# in base64 encoded PEM format and contain nothing more than the base64 data block
# delimited by -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and -----END CERTIFICATE-----
ssl.strictTrust=false

# The password to be used for loading the java VMs system certificate keystore, this
# file is located at JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts , there is no need to change
# this setting unless you have explicitly altered the keystore password for this file
# after installing the java environment. This setting is only used when strictTrust
# is enabled.
ssl.keystore.password=changeit

# Internal bot name, there is no need to change this unless you use the multiple bots
# option, in that case only this name will be used to identify a bot in things like
# site irc commands
# NOTE: you cannot have the character | in the name

# Enable multiple bots, this option is pretty simplistic if used. Multiple bots will be
# spawned each using their own set of config files, one bot will be spawned using the
# main files and then an additional bot for each additional config dir specified. The
# bots have no awareness of each other and act completely independently. This support
# is mainly intended for use in situations such as having a sitebot on multiple irc
# networks at once
bot.multiple.enable=false

# A space separated list of directories to look for additional bot config files in,
# these are expected to be subdirectories of conf/plugins/irc and must contain a
# copy of all config files the sitebot plugin and any of its plugins require, this
# option is only relevant if the previous option is enabled
