# Enabled cipher suites
# If left empty, default set will be used.
# Use whitelist to add specific chiphers to use.
# All supported ciphers not included in whitelist will be removed.
# Use blacklist to exclude ciphers.
# Blacklist can be combined with whitelist, if no whitelist rule(s) are
# specified blacklist will exclude from default set.
# Blacklist has precedence over whitelist.
# Both blacklist and whitelist use regular expression pattern.
# Multiple whitelist/blacklist rules are supported.

# Slave partial remerge functionality
# There are three possible settings for this mode:
# off - a full remerge will be performed on connect
# connect - any files newer than the last connect remerge for
#           the slave will be remerged
# disconnect - any files newer than the last time the Slave
#              disconnected will be remerged (CURRENTLY BROKEN)
# instant - throws slaves online instant and makes full remerge in background
#				Disclaimer. It's stable, but under development

# Sets whether a partially uploaded file is deleted on the
# slave if the upload is aborted. Having this set to false
# does not preclude any post hooks running on the transfer
# command from deleting the file anyway.

# Suggested values:
#   Higher values reduce disk I/O but at the penalty of latency in commits.
