SITE ADDUSER
USAGE: site adduser <user> <password> [<ident@ip#1> ... <ident@ip#5>]

Adds a user. You can have wildcards for users that have dynamic ips Examples: *@192.168.1.* , frank@192.168.*.* , bob@192.*.*.* (*@192.168.1.1[5-9] will allow only 192.168.1.15-19 to connect but no one else)

If a user is added by a groupadmin, that user will inherit the groupadmin's group.

All default values for the user are read from config conf/plugins/defaultuser.conf 

ex. site ADDUSER Archimede mypassword

This would add the user 'Archimede' with the password 'mypassword'.

ex. site ADDUSER Archimede mypassword *@127.0.0.1

This would do the same as above + add the ip '*@127.0.0.1' at the same time.

SITE CHANGE
USAGE: site change <user> <field> <value> - change a field for a user

Fields available:

ratio
Upload/Download ratio. 0 = Unlimited (Leech)

credits

group_slots
Number of users a GADMIN is allowed to add. If you specify a second argument, it will be the number of leech accounts the gadmin can give (done by "site change user ratio 0") (2nd arg = leech slots)

comment
Changes the user's comment.

group
Changes the users primary group. Primary group is used in group ownership.

SITE CHGRP
Changes the users extra group. Extra group is used to give a user siteop/nuke/gadmin rights. 
It is similar to glftpd's flags. You can use them as custom flags or whatever you want and later specify special commands that are usable by only this group.

CHGRP adds a user to the group if he isnt already in it. If he is in the group, then he will be removed from it.

valid fields are: siteop, nuke, gadmin, deleted

USAGE: site chgrp <user> <group>

site chgrp <user> siteop
user gets siteop flag

site chgrp <user> nuke
user gets access to nuek command

site chgrp <user> gadmin
user is gadmin now (see group_slots for help on changing slots)

site chgrp <user> deleted
deletes the specified user, same as "site deluser <user>"

SITE WIPE
USAGE: SITE WIPE [-r] <file/dir>

Deletes files without removing credits. -r means delete recursively.
