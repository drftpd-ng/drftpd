UPGRADING

Replace classes/ and src/, update all .conf files with new or changed 
directives found in the correlating .dist files
Especially make sure commandhandlers.conf gets updated as new commands 
won't be recognized if commandhandlers.conf isn't up-to-date.

1.1.4 --> 2.0
run bin/xstream2beans.sh before starting the daemon
rm slaves.xml (you will need to create them again, described in MAJORCHANGES.txt)
delete files.mlst(don't worry, it will be recreated)
